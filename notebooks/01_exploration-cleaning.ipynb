Project summary\n___\n\nThis is part of a project to build a sentiment classifier trained on Yelp review data (https://www.yelp.com/dataset). The project has been divided into several modules to perform different parts of the analysis, e.g., data cleaning, data processing, and model training. The goal is to predict the sentiment of a document; while using Yelp reviews of businesses, the 1-5 star rating acts as a proxy for sentiment, and the written Yelp review as the document text. The project is written in Python on Jupyter notebooks and makes use of a range of data science tools like pandas, spaCy, word2vec, and keras. My motivation in starting this project is to build my skillset, learn new tools, and improve as a data scientist. It is an ongoing project and may see many updates/iterations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. Module Overview\n___\n\n## Goal\n- The goal of this module is to prepare Yelp review data for eventual training and evaluation of a sentiment classifier\n    - Data Exploration:\n        - The data are inspected to identify structure, data-types, data classes, distributions, missing values, etc.\n    - Data Reduction:\n        - Only a representative subsample of the dataset is kept for more efficient data analysis\n        - Irrelevant features are removed (e.g., date, business ID)\n    - Data Cleaning:\n        - Data are cleaned to ensure no missing values, duplicates, etc.\n        - Minimal cleaning of the review text is performed, e.g., replacing odd whitespaces, backslashes, etc.\n- The above steps are organized for clarity but are not performed in the exact order listed\n- Prepared data are saved in an ouput json file for processing by the next module\n\n## Data\n- Input Data:\n    - `yelp-dataset`\n    - Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset\n    - Yelp: https://www.yelp.com/dataset\n- Description from the kaggle dataset page:\n> This dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. It was originally put together for the Yelp Dataset Challenge which is a chance for students to conduct research or analysis on Yelp's data and share their discoveries. In the most recent dataset you'll find information about businesses across 8 metropolitan areas in the USA and Canada.\n- Specifically, I analyze the `yelp-dataset/yelp_academic_dataset_review.json` file which contains data pertaining to Yelp user reviews and includes the text of the review and an associated 1-5 star rating of the Yelp user's experience (among other data, e.g., date, business ID, etc.)\n- Data are indexed per review with no discernable sorting\n\n## Libraries\n- Key Libraries:\n    - `Pandas` - used to read, load, store, inspect, process, and save the data\n        - webpage: https://pandas.pydata.org/\n\n## Output\n- Output:\n    - `/kaggle/working/cleaned_reduced_data.json`\n- This json file contains a reduced dataset of the input data that has been cleaned and prepared for NLP","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.

not more 1 star reviews, as I imagine many people feel inclined to leave feedback after a very negative experience\n- Based on a cursury read of some of the more negative sounding reviews, is seems as

taking a subset with a uniform distribution of star ratings, as training a model on data with an uneven class distribution can lead to bias\n- There is also a good reason to keep this distribution, as it is a real feature of user sentiment and we want a model that will reflect that\n- I will retain this data and make that decision later in the analysis\n- This also allows me to group the classes

My daughter is now four and a half and I have a one-and-a-half-year-old son. I switched school districts from Carson to Washoe and I kept going to all of these other daycare places and not getting a great feel, as well as the fact that they were totally booked for having an infant\\toddler. I needed a place for both of my kids and there was just no where for my son..... My gut kept telling me go back to Circle of Friends. I've been extremely happy. Are there always going to be kids who attended daycare that I do not agree with their behavior? absolutely! There is no way to get around that whether it is in school, daycare, or a sports team or some other organized deal. I try the best of my ability to not let those other children's behaviors influence my own and we talk about it. Well the best you can for a 4 year old! I really like Linda and the whole staff. She has a little turnover and I really like that. The first place that my kids were at in Carson had turn over all the time..... The second place was a home daycare so she didn't turn over herself, and the other place was a mother and daughter run joint as well. They had very little turnover.

I switched school districts from Carson to Washoe and I kept going to all of these other daycare places and not getting a great feel, as well as the fact that they were totally booked for having an infant toddler. I needed a place for both of my kids and there was just no where for my son..... My gut kept telling me go back to Circle of Friends. I've been extremely happy.

There is no way to get around that whether it is in school, daycare, or a sports team or some other organized deal.

Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone.

The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker.  \n1  I've taken a lot of spin classes over the years, and nothing compares to the classes at Body Cycle. From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out. For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do). There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!  \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations.

Yummy, different, delicious. Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma. With 10 different kinds of naan!!! Don't let the outside deter you (because we almost changed our minds)...go in and try something new!

Cheese curds were very good and very filling. Really like that sandwiches come w salad, esp after eating too many curds! Had the onion, gruyere, tomato sandwich. Wasn't too much cheese which I liked. Needed something else...pepper jelly maybe. Would like to see more menu options added such as salads w fun cheeses. Lots of beer and wine as well as limited cocktails.
