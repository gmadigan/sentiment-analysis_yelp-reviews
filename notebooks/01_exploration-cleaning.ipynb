not more 1 star reviews, as I imagine many people feel inclined to leave feedback after a very negative experience\n- Based on a cursury read of some of the more negative sounding reviews, is seems as

taking a subset with a uniform distribution of star ratings, as training a model on data with an uneven class distribution can lead to bias\n- There is also a good reason to keep this distribution, as it is a real feature of user sentiment and we want a model that will reflect that\n- I will retain this data and make that decision later in the analysis\n- This also allows me to group the classes

My daughter is now four and a half and I have a one-and-a-half-year-old son. I switched school districts from Carson to Washoe and I kept going to all of these other daycare places and not getting a great feel, as well as the fact that they were totally booked for having an infant\\toddler. I needed a place for both of my kids and there was just no where for my son..... My gut kept telling me go back to Circle of Friends. I've been extremely happy. Are there always going to be kids who attended daycare that I do not agree with their behavior? absolutely! There is no way to get around that whether it is in school, daycare, or a sports team or some other organized deal. I try the best of my ability to not let those other children's behaviors influence my own and we talk about it. Well the best you can for a 4 year old! I really like Linda and the whole staff. She has a little turnover and I really like that. The first place that my kids were at in Carson had turn over all the time..... The second place was a home daycare so she didn't turn over herself, and the other place was a mother and daughter run joint as well. They had very little turnover.

I switched school districts from Carson to Washoe and I kept going to all of these other daycare places and not getting a great feel, as well as the fact that they were totally booked for having an infant toddler. I needed a place for both of my kids and there was just no where for my son..... My gut kept telling me go back to Circle of Friends. I've been extremely happy.

There is no way to get around that whether it is in school, daycare, or a sports team or some other organized deal.

From the nice, clean space and amazing bikes, to the welcoming and motivating instructors, every class is a top notch work out. For anyone who struggles to fit workouts in, the online scheduling system makes it easy to plan ahead (and there's no need to line up way in advanced like many gyms make you do). There is no way I can write this review without giving Russell, the owner of Body Cycle, a shout out. Russell's passion for fitness and cycling is so evident, as is his desire for all of his clients to succeed. He is always dropping in to classes to check in/provide encouragement, and is open to ideas and recommendations from anyone. Russell always wears a smile on his face, even when he's kicking your butt in class!  \n2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Family diner. Had the buffet. Eclectic assortment: a large chicken leg, fried jalapeño, tamale, two rolled grape leaves, fresh melon. All good. Lots of Mexican choices there. Also has a menu with breakfast served all day long. Friendly, attentive staff. Good place for a casual relaxed meal with no expectations.

Yummy, different, delicious. Our favorite is the lamb curry and korma. With 10 different kinds of naan!!!
