# sentiment-analysis_yelp-reviews
This is a project to build a sentiment classifier trained on Yelp review data (https://www.yelp.com/dataset). The project has been divided into several modules (see the `notebooks` directory) to perform different parts of the analysis, e.g., data cleaning, data processing, and model training. The goal is to predict the sentiment of a document; while using Yelp reviews of businesses, the 1-5 star rating acts as a proxy for sentiment, and the written Yelp review as the document text. The project is written in Python on Jupyter notebooks and makes use of a range of data science tools like `pandas`, `spaCy`, `word2vec`, and `keras`. My motivation in starting this project is to build my skillset, learn new tools, and improve as a data scientist. It is an ongoing project and may see many updates/iterations.
